\title{Retrieve correspondence tables between statistical classifications from CELLAR and FAO repositories.}
\usage{
retrieveCorrespondenceTable(
  prefix,
  endpoint,
  ID_table,
  language = "en",
  CSVout = FALSE,
  showQuery = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{prefix}{Prefixes are typically defined at the beginning of a SPARQL query 
and are used throughout the query to make it more concise and easier to read. 
Multiple prefixes can be defined in a single query to cover different namespaces used in the dataset.
The function 'classificationEndpoint()' can be used to generate the prefixes for the selected correspondence table.}

\item{endpoint}{SPARQL endpoints provide a standardized way to access data sets, 
making it easier to retrieve specific information or perform complex queries on linked data.
The valid values are \code{"CELLAR"} or \code{"FAO"}.}

\item{ID_table}{Refers to a unique identifier associated with a specific correspondence table. 
The ID_table can be obtained by utilizing the "correspondenceList()" function.}

\item{language}{Refers to the specific language used for providing label, include and exclude information in the selected correspondence table. 
By default is set to "en". This is an optional argument.}

\item{CSVout}{The valid values are \code{FALSE} or \code{TRUE}. In both cases the correspondence table as an R object. 
If output should be saved as a csv file, the argument should be set as \code{TRUE}. By default, no csv file is produced.}

\item{showQuery}{The valid values are \code{FALSE} or \code{TRUE}. In both cases the correspondence table as an R object. 
If needed to view the SPARQL query used, the argument should be set as \code{TRUE}. By default, no SPARQL query is produced.}
}
\value{
\code{retrieveCorrespondenceTable()} returns a classification tables from CELLAR and FAO. The table includes the following variables:
 \itemize{
    \item Source Classification name (e.g. cn2019): the code of each object in the source classification
    \item Source Classification name (e.g. cn2021): the code of each object in the target classification
    \item Target Classification label: the corresponding label of each object (e.g. cn2019)
    \item Include: include details on each object (e.g. cn2019)
    \item Exclude: details on each object (e.g. cn2019)
    \item Target Classification label: the corresponding label of each object (e.g. cn2021)
    \item Include: include details on each object (e.g. cn2021)
    \item Exclude: details on each object (e.g. cn2021)
    \item Comment: details on each object, if available 
    \item URL: the URL from which the SPARQL query was retrieved
}
}
\description{
To facilitate the utilization of correspondence tables as inputs for the newCorrespondenceTable and updateCorrespondenceTable functions, 
"retrieveCorrespondenceTable" utility function has been developed. This utility function leverage R packages that enable SPARQL queries.

\examples{
{
    endpoint = "CELLAR"
    prefix = "cn2022"
    ID_table = "CN2022_NST2007"
    
    results_ls = retrieveCorrespondenceTable(prefix, endpoint, ID_table)
    
    # View SPARQL Query
    cat(results_ls[[1]])
    
    #View Classification Table
    #View(results_ls[[2]])
    }
